About
Iâ€™m Janai Campbell, a senior in the B.S./M.S. Computational Science and Engineering program at Kean University. 
I create interactive 3D projects in Blender and Unity, combining physics, computer science, 
and VR research to design immersive experiences and scientific visualizations. I am familiar with a few different languages but my go to is typically Python. 
I have been working as a VR researcher for the past 3 years and I am super passionate about it. These are just a few minor projects that I have worked on in the past 3 years until now.
